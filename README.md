# Health-Tracker:
This is a website which allows us to stay updated with daily news from all over the world and also keeps us updated on the worldwide cases along with a heatMap to show the concentration
of the cases in different parts of the world. Also the heatmap can show how the transition of covid came into play and how it spread all over the world. The main problem it solves is the 
scarcity of hospitalities available all around the world. The site has a self assessment test which can be taken and response can be produced within a day to direct the steps and precaution that can be taken
